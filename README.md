# Weather Mate

Weather Mate is a Flutter-based mobile application that provides real-time weather updates and AI-based activity predictions. The app leverages clean architecture principles to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## Features

- User Authentication: Login and registration using Firebase.

- AI-Based Prediction: Predicts if specific conditions (like playing tennis) are suitable based on weather data.


## App Architecture

The app follows clean architecture, structured in three layers:

- Presentation Layer: Manages the UI and state with BLoC/Cubit for smooth state management.
- Domain Layer: Contains the core business logic, use cases, and entities.
- Data Layer: Interacts with external APIs (Weather API) and Firebase for authentication.
## Technologies Used

- Flutter: For cross-platform mobile development.
- Firebase: For user authentication.
- Weather API: For fetching real-time weather data.
- Local AI Model: For activity predictions based on weather conditions.
